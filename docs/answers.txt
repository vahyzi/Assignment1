Branches help separate different projects so that it is easy to push out only finished projects. Branches also tend to be easier than cloned directories for pulling in changes and for sharing changes across multiple projects.

f)

git log: The command takes options applicable to the git rev-list command to control what is shown and how, and options applicable to the git diff-* commands to control how the changes each commit introduces are shown.

git status: Displays paths that have differences between the index file and the current HEAD commit, paths that have differences between the working tree and the index file, and paths in the working tree that are not tracked by Git

g)

git log --follow Weapon.h

git log --grep=file

i)

inheritance: a process of creating new classes from existing classes

polymorphism: the ability to present the same interface for differing underlying forms

encapsulation: a language mechanism for restricting direct access to some of the object's components or a language construct that facilitates the bundling of data with the methods (or other functions) operating on that data.

7)

It is using both inheritance and polymorphism.
Each individual weapon is inheriting from the main weapon class.
Each weapon is being displayed the same way despite being different weapons which is polymorphism.
